# ðŸ§  Loopbreaker

A minimalist psychological game where players detect hidden patterns or get trapped in noise.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- Observe a 4-number sequence.
- Decide: Is it a **pattern** or **random noise**?
- Click "Pattern" or "Noise" to respond.
- Survive 5 rounds and awaken... or be consumed by the loops.

## ðŸš€ Run Locally
